# normalize
This repository stores code to normalize XLS/CSV  files
The CSV resulted not well formatted
So I will concentrate on the XLS files
Several  XLS files does not contain any geographical information.
For this reason I developed a code to prepare an index as the one at the end of a book.
Word, list of files.
I read all the files in the cuaderno de campo.
